# Rapid Cycle Edit-Compile-Debug for Developing C#.NEO Smart Contracts - NEO Community Tech Note

[NEO Blockchain C# Center of Excellence](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-csharpcoe/blob/master/README.md)

The `neo-csharpcoe` project is an "umbrella" project for several initiatives related to providing tools and libraries (code), frameworks, how-to documentation, and best practices for full-stack development using .NET/C# and C#.NEO and the NEO Blockchain software platform.

The `neo-csharpcoe` is an independent, free, open source project that is 100% community-supported by people like yourself through your contributions of time, energy, passion, promotion, and donations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is describe best practices for iteratively developing and debuffing C#.NEO smart contracts using Visual Studio and the neo-debugger. This document is specifically targeted at .NET developers and architects. 

## Scenario

* You've created a simple, single source file C#.NEO smart contract or a more elaborate smart contract that spans multiple C#.NEO source files (all in the same project). The latter may contain multiple C# files and/or C# partial classes (or regular C# classes).

## Problem

* The edit-compile-debug (EDC) cycle on any platform can be tedious, time-wasting and unproductive. The NEO Community TechNote describes the best approaches for acclerating the ECD for developing and debuggin C#.NET smart contracts using Visual Studio.

## Analysis

* The most common C#.NET developer toolset consists of:
   * Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (free license)
   * neo-debugger (open source project)
   * neo-gui-developer (open source project)
   * git and github.com for source version control and management

## Options

* The default option is the use these tools separately - in a non-intregated, disconnected workflow. The collective knowlege and experience of the C#.NEO community has found many ways to help you improve your productivity with C#.NEO.  

## Solution

The high-level solution consists of:

* Knowing which tools to use when and what for
* Knowing how to integrate and connect the tools so that they work better for the way you want to work
